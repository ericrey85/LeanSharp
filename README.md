# LeanSharp
LeanSharp allows you to write code in a more declarative and functional way in C#.

By using LeanSharp, a lot of boilerplate and imperative code can be removed from your codebase.
To understand how each Class/Method works, take a look at the unit tests, which cover almost 100% of the source code.

One of the things provided by this project is the potential to use Railway-Oriented Programming (ROP) in C#. The code related to ROP was initially taken from https://github.com/habaneroofdoom/AltNetRop and then based on real world usage it was grown and tweaked to its current state. In the same way, the Maybe monad used in here was taken from https://gist.github.com/johnazariah/d95c03e2c56579c11272a647bab4bc38, feel free to navigate there to see a good explanation about it.
